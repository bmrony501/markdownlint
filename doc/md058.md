# `MD058` - Tables should be surrounded by blank lines

Tags: `table`

Aliases: `blanks-around-tables`

Fixable: Some violations can be fixed by tooling

This rule is triggered when tables are either not preceded or not followed by a
blank line:

```markdown
Some text
| Header | Header |
| ------ | ------ |
| Cell   | Cell   |
> Blockquote
```

To fix violations of this rule, ensure that all tables have a blank line both
before and after (except when the table is at the very beginning or end of the
document):

```markdown
Some text

| Header | Header |
| ------ | ------ |
| Cell   | Cell   |

> Blockquote
```

Rationale: In addition to aesthetic reasons, some parsers will not parse tables
that don't have blank lines before and after them.
